# Understanding the Kanji - Business Requirements

## Copyright Disclaimer

This application is based on the curriculum taught in
[James W Heisig's "Remembering the Kanji"](https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921)
. Although this application uses the keywords, primitives, and indexes provided in his work; this program is meant to
complement, rather than replace, his work. Heisig's book guides you through the first 500+ Kanji characters through
stories and plots not included in this program. Additionally, he teaches you how to come up with your own stories, which
this program will not address. This program also does not provide an explanation into how or why his method is so
effective. For all of that (and more), you will need to purchase his book (provided in the link above).

## Goals of the Project

The Understanding the Kanji education tool will have two main purposes.

1. Provide a lookup tool for Kanji characters based on specific search criteria.
2. Provide a spaced-repetition-based flashcard system to facilitate easy learning of the Kanji.

### Kanji Lookup Tool

Kanji characters will be available for lookup by three optional search criteria:

1. RTK (Heisig) Index
2. Kanji Character Unicode
3. RTK (Heisig) Keyword

The Kanji lookup page will consist of the three fields, with a "Submit" button below to submit choices. There will also
be a "Back" button to return to the main screen.

The results page will consist of query results, and the user will be given the option to select one of them.

When one of the results is selected, a new window containing information about the Kanji will be displayed.

### Spaced Repetition Flashcard System (like Anki)

Spaced repetition flashcard systems are designed to quiz the end user on certain information in certain intervals that
will make the information more-memorable.
